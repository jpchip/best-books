# Best Books

This repo contains a simple web app that displays the [Books Everyone Should Read](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/novels-everyone-should-read-interactive/)

## Story

When I worked for Earthling Interactive, I discovered [this list](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/novels-everyone-should-read-interactive/) and thought it would be fun to have everyone in the office highlight the books they've read, and then I would hang them all 
up on our office wall as a kind of [office art project](https://www.flickr.com/photos/24311566@N07/albums/72157626204859903/). Looking back, I realize it mostly ended up being a way to shame/embarass my office mates who weren't big readers, and I feel
kinda bad about it.

Anyway, now you too can shame your friends/family/co-workers/enemies from the comfort of a website!
